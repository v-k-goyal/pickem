# pickem
Calculations and optimizations for confidence-weighted pick'em contests

The MATLAB code and .mat files here reproduce the figures in the abstract submission
"Strategies for Confidence-Weighted Pick'Em" by running script2_png.m and script3_png.m.

Files too large for GitHub are available at
https://vivekgoyal.org/pickem/8d_computations.mat
https://vivekgoyal.org/pickem/8f_computations.mat

If a full submission is invited, the full codebase will be thoroughly explained.
